# Productive Break Chat Guide

## The 4000% Productivity Hack

Alex Finn discovered that using productive breaks while Claude Code is working can increase productivity by 4000%. Instead of doom scrolling, use this time for mental clarity and creative thinking.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Open Claude.ai in a new browser tab**
   - Keep this tab open alongside your Claude Code terminal
   - Use during code generation and processing times

2. **Save the Productive Break Prompt**

Copy and save this prompt for easy access:

```
When I am coding with AI there are long breaks in between me giving commands to the AI. Typically I spend that time doom scrolling which distracts me and puts me in a bad mental state. I'd like to use that time now to chat with you and generate new ideas, and also reflect on my other ideas and businesses and content. I'm not sure how I'd like to use this chat or what role I'd like you to play, but I think it could be much more useful than me doom scrolling. What do you think? What could be the best way for us to use this chat?
```

### Planning Next Steps:
"My app's MVP is almost done. What are the most important features to add next from a user retention perspective?"

### Personal Development:
"I've been coding for 3 hours straight. Can you help me think about how to maintain better work-life balance as a developer?"
